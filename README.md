Rock Paper Scissors Game

In these 2 copies of the game I wrote last night one works fine. The other works but the logic is messing up when the User plays paper and computer plays rock. Given the win to the computer. If anyone happens to take time to look at this help me understand why this is. As i am new to coding. The working file is rockpaper.py and the one with the logic issue is rock_paper_scissors.py. Thanks for any input.
